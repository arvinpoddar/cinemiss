# Cinemiss

See how much of a movie's budget you miss while blinking. Built with Vue and powered by the TMDB API.

I originally built this project with PHP (I don't know why either), and recently decided to port it over to Vue. I added the ability to have multiple search results, and did a huge style overhaul.

## Project setup
